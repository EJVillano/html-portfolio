<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2> 

<hr />

<h3>Weathering with you</h3>
<p>the  line "Who cares if we don’t see the sunshine ever again? I want you more than any blue sky! The weather can go crazy!".</p>

<h3>Suzume no Tojimari</h3>
<p>Amazing graphics and plot twist in the end. It is really relatable for some one who is lost in life.</p>

<h3>To Me, The One Who Loved You First & To Every You I’ve Loved Before</h3>
<p> Amazing idea by the author to make two movies that makes one whole movie and can be interchangeable in what order to watch.
